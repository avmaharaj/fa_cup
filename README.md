# fa_cup

This project investigates whether the competetiveness of the FA cup has diminished over the past few years. A common complaint among media types is that the "Magic of the FA cup" has been lost. While it is hard to know exactly what this means, it is roughly a complaint that lower division teams are no longer competitive. That "magical" cup runs by lower division teams no longer occur. Here, we aim to determine whether the data support this picture.
